This is my first python/pygame project!

Install python **2.7** from the website(python.org). make sure you select include path in the installer.

once installed, enter command prompt, and enter the command 'cd c:/python27/scripts'. This will enter the command line inside the scripts folder for python. Now enter the command 'pip install pygame'. This installs pygame, as you may have guessed, which is the most important part of the game.

Add the files to your desktop in a new folder

Enjoy the game!
